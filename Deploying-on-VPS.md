# How to deploy?
Deploying is pretty much straight forward and is divided into several steps as follows:
## Installing requirements

- Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/SlamDevs/slam-mirrorbot mirrorbot/
cd mirrorbot
```

- Install requirements
For Debian based distros
```
sudo apt install python3
```
Install Docker by following the [official Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)

OR
```
sudo snap install docker 
```
- For Arch and it's derivatives:
```
sudo pacman -S docker python
```
- Install dependencies for running setup scripts:
```
pip3 install -r requirements-cli.txt
```


## Deploying On VPS

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: You must set `SERVER_PORT` variable to `80` or any other port you want to use.

- Start Docker daemon (skip if already running):
```
sudo dockerd
```
- Build Docker image:
```
sudo docker build . -t mirror-bot
```
- Run the image:
```
sudo docker run -p 80:80 mirror-bot
```
OR

**NOTE**: If you want to use port other than 80, change it in [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/SlamDevs/slam-mirrorbot/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)

- Using Docker-compose, you can edit and build your image in seconds:
```
sudo apt install docker-compose
```
- Build and run Docker image:
```
sudo docker-compose up
```
- After editing files with nano for example (nano start.sh):
```
sudo docker-compose build
sudo docker-compose up
```
OR
```
sudo docker-compose up --build
```
- To stop Docker: 
```
sudo docker ps
```
```
sudo docker stop id
```
- To clear the container (this will not affect the image):
```
sudo docker container prune
```
- To delete the image:
```
sudo docker image prune -a
```
