# Youtube-dl authentication using [.netrc](https://github.com/SlamDevs/slam-mirrorbot/blob/master/.netrc) file
For using your premium accounts in Youtube-dl or for protected Index Links, edit the netrc file according to following format:
```
machine host login username password my_youtube_password
```
For Index Link with only password without username, even http auth will not work, so this is the solution.
```
machine example.workers.dev password index_password
```
Where host is the name of extractor (eg. Youtube, Twitch). Multiple accounts of different hosts can be added each separated by a new line.
